= Welcome to GangstaMail

This is a simple email parser. It is primarily for demonstration purposes, as it
makes some assumptions for the sake of simplicity. Some of these assumptions are
faulty. This program assumes:

* We don't need to optimize for speed
* Email body is separated from header by one blank line
* No multi-line fields in email header
* There's only one Received: field.
